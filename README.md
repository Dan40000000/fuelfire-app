# FuelFire Fitness App 🔥

### Firebase (AI subscriptions backend)
`api/subscriptions.js` will use Firestore if these env vars are set (otherwise it falls back to a local JSON file):

```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=service-account@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n
```

Add them locally in a `.env` (see `.env.example`) and in your deploy settings (Vercel/Netlify/etc.). Keep the `\n` newline escapes in the private key. The paywall auto-logs subscription events to Firestore when these are present.

### Stripe billing (Elite/Premium/Core subscriptions)
- Create a Stripe account and enable payouts.
- Create recurring prices in Stripe (e.g., Elite ~$96/mo, Premium $15/mo, Core $6/mo after the 20% uplift) and capture their price IDs.
- Add these env vars (see `.env.example`):
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_or_test
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_or_test
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_from_dashboard
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PREMIUM=price_for_premium
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_CORE=price_for_core
```
- Deploy the webhook endpoint `api/stripe-webhook.js` to your host and point a Stripe webhook at it for events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.created/updated/deleted`.
- The paywall uses `/api/create-checkout-session` to start Stripe Checkout and `/api/stripe-config` to pull price IDs; successful webhooks post into the same subscription log store used by the Account page admin dashboard.

### Apple IAP via RevenueCat (optional) + Android Play Billing
- Create products/entitlements in RevenueCat that mirror Elite/Premium/Core (and map to Apple/Google products).
- Set `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` if you want webhook auth, and point RevenueCat webhooks to `/api/revenuecat-webhook`.
- Webhook events (purchase/renew/cancel/expire) write into the same subscription log store (Firestore or local JSON), so Account admin tables stay consistent across Stripe and Apple purchases.
- Native → webview unlock: send `postMessage` with `{ type: 'RC_ENTITLEMENT', entitlement: 'premium', email, name, expiresAt }` or call `window.RCBridge.applyEntitlement(...)` from native to unlock the paywall and log the event. Script is loaded on pages that use AI paywall (`revenuecat-bridge.js`).
- See `APP_STORE_IAP_SETUP.md` for a concise integration and testing checklist.
